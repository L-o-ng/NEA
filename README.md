This Non-Examined assessment is for the AQA Computer Science A-Level in 2023. It scored 74/75, losing 1 mark in the analysis section of the documentation.

The project is a gRPC-powered local network with a backend maze generator and solver, and a frontend interactive display. It allows for:
- Unique password-protected profiles;
- Saving and loading mazes from the server;
- Viewing local and global statistics on a 3D graph;
- Manual solving with uploadable times;
- Algorithmic solving.
The algorithms implemented include:
- Recursive backtrack generation;
- Growing tree generation;
- Wilson's Algorithmic generation;
- Recursive backtracking solve;
- A bad implementation of the [Maze Routing Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze-solving_algorithm)
- Breadth-First search.
